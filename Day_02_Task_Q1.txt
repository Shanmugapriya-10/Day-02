1. Write a blog on the difference between document and window objects?

Document Object:
A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object 
for manipulation inside the document.

Window Object: 
The window is at a root/top level at the JavaScript object hierarchy. 
It  is a global/root object in JavaScript and it is the root object of the Document object model(DOM);
